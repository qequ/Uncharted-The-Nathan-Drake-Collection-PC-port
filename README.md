# Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection — PC port

Run the PS4 **Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection** (CUSA02344: *Drake's Fortune*, *Among
Thieves* and *Drake's Deception*) natively on Windows. The game's own x86-64 code runs directly
on the PC; a runtime supplies the PS4 system libraries, and a Vulkan renderer executes the PS4 GPU
work.

## Status

| Game | Plays | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Uncharted: Drake's Fortune | Yes | 60 FPS in the tested areas. Native rendering up to 2880x1620 (4K output through FSR 1). |
| Uncharted 2: Among Thieves | Yes | Played at 1440p and 4K. Light scenes 60 FPS; the heaviest scenes 40-45 FPS (CPU-bound, see below). |
| Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception | Yes | 1080p tested in play; 1440p and 4K start, play testing in progress. |

The Collection menu, switching between the three games, saves, audio (music, speech, effects),
cutscene movies and controllers work. Details and open issues: [analysis/STATUS.md](analysis/STATUS.md);
plan and test list: [analysis/PLAN.md](analysis/PLAN.md).

## Features

**Launcher** (`Uncharted Launcher.exe`)
- A card per game; settings are kept **per game**.
- Quality presets:

  | Preset | Render resolution | Frame rate | For |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Low | 720p + FSR 1 to the screen | 60 | weak GPUs (about twice as fast as 1080p) |
  | Medium | 1080p (as on PS4) | 60 | most PCs |
  | High | 1440p | 60 | fast GPUs |
  | Ultra | 4K (Drake's Fortune: 1620p + FSR 1) | up to 120 (experimental) | very fast GPUs |

  Every preset queues 1 frame. 2 frames queued is faster in heavy scenes, but GPU results
  reach the game a frame later: keep it at 1.

  **Low-end PCs and laptops:** turn on **Multithreaded rendering** (launcher, **Performance**
  tab, per game) and keep **Frames queued at 1**. The PS4's GPU commands are otherwise processed
  on one CPU core, which limits slower CPUs; with this option the Vulkan command recording runs on a
  second core. On fast desktop CPUs it makes no difference. With a weak GPU also pick the **Low**
  preset (720p + FSR 1). If a game hangs while loading, turn the option off again.

- **Display:** windowed, borderless or exclusive fullscreen; render resolution 720p, 900p, 1080p,
  1440p, 1620p or 4K; FSR 1 upscaling; RCAS sharpening; FPS counter.
- **Performance:** frame rate limit 30 / 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 / 120 (60 is the PS4's; 120 is
  experimental, and faster rates break the games' movement, so they are not offered); frames
  queued; background shader compilation; multithreaded rendering (experimental).
- **Keyboard and mouse:** mouse look (sensitivity, invert Y), right mouse aim, left mouse fire, WASD,
  and every action remappable per game in the **Controls** tab (two bindings per action, keys or
  mouse buttons). Controllers (DualSense, DualShock 4, Xbox) work at the same time.
- **Game update 1.02** is used automatically when it sits next to the game folder (see below).
- Log and save folders, desktop shortcut, shader cache reset, game folder selection, links to the
  author's [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BilalReloaded/videos) and GitHub.

**In game:** `Insert` or `R3 + L2` opens the menu (display mode, frame rate, sharpening, overlay).

**Under the hood**
- Native execution of the three game executables; the Collection's game switching (LoadExec).
- shadPS4-derived Vulkan renderer with a persistent shader/pipeline cache, asynchronous shader
  compilation, and fixes for this game: GPU-written constants synced back to the CPU, MUBUF
  ADDR64 loads (character shadows), direct memory access for the tiled lighting, depth/stencil
  aliasing, CPU writes next to GPU data without stalls, GPU ray-cast results returned to the game
  (Drake's Fortune's bullet impacts, blood and decals), tolerant handling of garbage descriptors.
- Render resolution patch: the games' display settings and memory map are rewritten for the chosen
  resolution; cutscene movies are scaled to it and their conversion shader adjusted.
- FFmpeg-based video decoding (Videodec2), ATRAC9 audio (LibAtrac9), SDL3 window and controllers.

## Known issues

- **Frame rate in the heaviest Uncharted 2 scenes is about 50 FPS** at any resolution: the
  PS4's GPU command processing runs on one CPU core here (3,000-5,600 draws per frame). Lighter
  scenes reach 60. More optimization is planned.
- **Multithreaded rendering is experimental:** its crashes with 1 frame queued are fixed. It is
  meant for low-end PCs and laptops (see the presets above) and gives no speed-up on fast CPUs;
  with "Frames queued 2" Uncharted 2 can still stop with the game assert `m_gfxEopTick`, so keep 1.
- **Uncharted 3:** Sully's shirt in the bar can flicker at 60 FPS (not at 30).
- **Recording with OBS Game Capture:** if OBS keeps losing and re-hooking the game, the game's
  memory use grows (each hook creates DirectX devices in the game). With an NVIDIA card set
  NVIDIA Control Panel -> Manage 3D settings -> Program settings -> Uncharted.exe ->
  **Vulkan/OpenGL present method: Prefer native**, or use OBS **Window Capture**.
- **Frames queued 2** is faster in heavy scenes, but GPU results reach the game a frame later
  (Uncharted 2's NPCs float, Nate's feet sink into the floor): keep it at 1 (every preset does).
- Drake's Fortune renders at most 2880x1620 (its memory layout) and upscales to 4K; turn on FSR 1.
- Frame rates above 120 are not offered: the games' movement breaks (Drake's Fortune at 160 FPS
  dropped Nate through the world).
- Uncharted 3 has had less play testing than the other two: please report crashes with the log
  (launcher **Advanced -> Open log folder**, `boot.log`).

## Playing

1. Download **Uncharted-windows.zip** from the latest release on the
   [Releases](../../releases) page (or a newer build from the
   [Actions](../../actions/workflows/build-windows.yml) tab, latest successful run → Artifacts),
   or build it yourself (below). Extract it anywhere.
2. Start **Uncharted Launcher.exe**. On the first Play, select your game folder: the dumped
   `CUSA02344` folder (the one holding `eboot.bin` and `sce_sys`, often called `uroot`).
3. **Recommended: update 1.02** (Bluepoint's stability, movie, audio and gameplay fixes). Extract
   the update next to the game folder, named like it plus `-patch` (for example `CUSA02344-patch`,
   with or without its `uroot` folder). The launcher's Advanced tab shows the version in use.
4. Pick a game and a preset, press **PLAY**. The first start of each game prepares files and
   compiles shaders: expect a slow first load and some stutter until the cache has filled.

**Requirements:** Windows 10/11 64-bit, a GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and a current driver (NVIDIA, AMD,
Intel), 16 GB RAM recommended, a 4-core CPU or better. Saves, logs and settings stay in the
`analysis` folder next to the launcher.

**Updates** (from version 0.1.1): the launcher checks the releases when it starts and shows
**UPDATE TO x.y.z** when there is a newer one. It downloads the package, checks its SHA-256 against
the release, replaces the program files (saves, settings and the shader cache stay) and starts
again; if anything fails, the installed version is put back. Advanced tab: turn the check off, or
check now.

## Building

GitHub Actions builds every push to `main` ([build-windows.yml](.github/workflows/build-windows.yml)).
To build locally, from an MSYS2 **CLANG64** shell:

```bash
pacman -S --needed git patch \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{toolchain,cmake,ninja,pkgconf,python} \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{vulkan-headers,vulkan-loader,vulkan-memory-allocator,glslang} \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{sdl3,fmt,boost,robin-map,xxhash,ffmpeg,zydis} \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{spirv-tools,spirv-headers,spirv-cross}
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bc160201983/Uncharted-The-Nathan-Drake-Collection-PC-port.git
cd Uncharted-The-Nathan-Drake-Collection-PC-port
gow3_pc/build.sh                 # the runtime: gow3_pc/out/gow3-probe.exe
tools/package_windows.sh         # dist/Uncharted-windows(.zip); needs a Windows Python 3.10+
                                 # with Pillow (PYTHON_HOME)
```

To run from the source tree: `Start-Uncharted.cmd` (launcher), or
`python tools/probe_uncharted.py --boot --seconds 0 --game <game folder>`. Play testing, with the
crash, freeze and F8 mark reports in `analysis/reports`: [analysis/PLAYTEST.md](analysis/PLAYTEST.md).

### Releases

`tools/release.sh 0.1.1` publishes version 0.1.1: write its text in
`tools/release-notes/v0.1.1.md` first. The script sets `tools/VERSION`, pushes the source and the
tag `v0.1.1`; GitHub Actions then builds the package and publishes the release with
`Uncharted-windows.zip` (about 20 minutes). The launcher offers newer releases as updates.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `launcher/` | The Uncharted launcher (Tkinter + Pillow). |
